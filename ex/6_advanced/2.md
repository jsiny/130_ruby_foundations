# Key take-aways from the examples

## Group 1

* Procs can be defined with the following notation: `proc { |param| ... }`
* Procs are instances of the class `Proc`
* A proc is called (`my_proc.call`)
* Procs have lenient arity rules: they can be called with less parameters than expected and will simply replace those parameters by `nil`

## Group 2

* A lambda can be created by the following notations:
 * `lambda { |param| ... }`
 * `-> (param) { ... }`
* A lambda is a type of `Proc` object: the `Lambda` class doesn't exist.
* Although a lambda is a `Proc`, it's a separate type of Proc, that can be recognized through its `(lambda)` attribute within its ID: `#<Proc:0x00007fffcac17420@2.rb:9 (lambda)>`
* A lambda is also called (`my_lambda.class`)
* However, lambdas have strict arity rules, and will throw an ArgumentError if called without the right number of arguments.

## Group 3

* If you want an argument to be passed to the block, you need to pass this variable as an argument to `yield`, as in `yield(animal)`
* Otherwise, the block gets executed without this argument
* However, if you call a method with a `yield` inside and no block is passed at method invocation time, then we get a `LocalJumpError`

## Group 4

* You can pass an argument to `yield` and this argument will be set to the block parameter within the pipes (`|`), to be referenced within the block
* If you provide less arguments than there are block parameters, the remaining parameters will be assigned to `nil`. Like Procs, block have lenient arity rules: no error will be thrown.
* The block cannot reference a variable that's not in scope within the block.

## To sum-up

* Lambdas are a particular type of `Proc` objects
* An implicit block is technically not an object
* Blocks and Procs have lenient arity rules and allow the passing of less/more arguments. Lambdas enforce strict arity rules and will throw an error if they receive too much or too few arguments.
